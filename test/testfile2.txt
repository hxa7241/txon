Definition
----------

It is a nestable key-value syntax structure: like a simplified JSON with only strings and objects, and a different textual representation. The basic structure is:

   name:`value`

This can be nested:

   name:` name2:`nested value` `

And names are optional and need not be unique, text content may be included alongside terms, and any layout is allowed:

   references:`
      JSON -- :`http://json.org/`
      Lua --  :`http://lua.org/`
   `

Outside an expression, only the sequence of : followed by ` is special and not generally allowed. Inside an expression, ` is special and not generally allowed, unless escaped with \.
